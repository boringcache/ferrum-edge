"""Fail CI when WRR selection reintroduces single-lane serialization.

Criterion fixture contract (see tests/performance/mesh/benches/wrr_selection.rs):
  - Each measured custom iteration runs ITERATIONS_PER_THREAD selections per
    worker thread (currently 50_000).
  - The 1-thread case therefore performs 50_000 selections per iteration.
  - The 4-thread case performs 4 * 50_000 selections per iteration.
  - Multi-thread samples reuse a long-lived barrier-synchronized worker pool;
    Criterion's mean is the wall time from barrier release until every worker
    completes the selection loop, not thread spawn/join overhead.
  - Criterion's mean point estimate is elapsed wall-clock nanoseconds for that
    whole custom iteration (not ns/selection).
  - Every fixture uses the intentional 5:1:…:1 weight skew from the bench.

Throughput speedup is therefore:

  speedup = (PARALLEL_THREADS * serial_ns) / parallel_ns

because rates are (elements / wall_ns) and the parallel iteration does
PARALLEL_THREADS times more work. A single-lane schedule mutex collapses this
toward 1.0x on fixtures where schedule work dominates output-Arc traffic.

Topology-aware gate (hosted evidence, run 31000740063):
  - 4 targets / 5:1:1:1 → heavy Arc share 5/8. Concurrent clone/drop of the
    same returned `Arc<UpstreamTarget>` produces cross-core strong-count
    bouncing that can push measured speedup *below* 1.0x (observed 0.80x)
    even on the wait-free sharded path. A mutex would sit near 1.0x, so a
    universal >1.10 floor is not a valid single-lane-mutex detector here.
  - 32 targets / 5:1:…:1 → heavy share 5/36. Observed 1.22x; mutex ~1.0x
    fails the hosted floor.
  - 129 targets → heavier per-pick work + heavy share 5/133. Observed 2.23x;
    mutex ~1.0x fails the hosted floor.

Therefore:
  - MANDATORY_SERIALIZATION_TARGETS (32, 129) must clear --min-parallel-speedup.
  - SMALL_CARDINALITY_SECONDARY_TARGETS (4) must still be measured and reported;
    parallel speedup is informational for Arc-hotspot regime, while the
    small-cardinality serial signal requires 4-target 1-thread wall time to
    stay within SMALL_CARDINALITY_SERIAL_RATIO_CEILING of the 32-target
    1-thread wall (same iteration count; hosted ratio ≈ 1.01).
