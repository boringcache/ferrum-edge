//! Gateway API `BackendTLSPolicy` watch/index/apply helpers.

//! Policies attach to same-namespace Services and overlay Ferrum upstream

//!
//! Two boundaries are load-bearing and deliberately explicit here:
//!
//! * `wellKnownCACertificates: System` projects the first-class

//!   the cluster-global `FERRUM_TLS_CA_BUNDLE_PATH` — so a cluster-wide private
//!   CA would silently replace the public trust anchors the policy asked for.
//! * A route whose backend set MIXES policy-covered and uncovered targets fails
//!   closed. Ferrum encodes one backend scheme and one TLS identity per
//!   `Upstream`, so applying the overlay to the combined upstream would
//!   originate TLS (with the covered Service's SNI and trust) to a Service that
