//! Install lifecycle for the chained `ferrum-cni` plugin: readiness-gated
//! automatic rollback, and the readiness marker the Helm cleanup hook uses to
//! report completion.
//!
//! # Why a rollback watcher exists
//!
//! Once `ferrum-cni install` writes the chained conflist, every pod ADD on
//! that node traverses `ferrum-cni`, and an unanswered ADD fails closed. That
//! is the intended capture-race posture, but it means an install that never
//! reaches a usable node-agent is a node-wide pod-creation outage rather than
//! a degraded optimization (issue #3609).
//!
//! The watcher runs beside the node-agent in the same pod. It polls the CNI
//! STATUS verb — the same readiness boundary kubelet would observe — and:
//!
//! - the moment STATUS answers `Ok`, it retains the artifacts permanently for
//!   that pod. A node-agent that later crashes is NOT rolled back: it was
//!   proven usable once, so removing the chain would silently drop capture
//!   for pods that are still expected to be enrolled.
//! - if STATUS never answers `Ok` before the deadline, it removes the
//!   artifacts **this pod's own installer wrote** and exits non-zero, so the
//!   node keeps creating pods and the failure stays visible.
//!
//! # Why the readiness budget does not start at container start
//!
//! The watcher is a native sidecar and therefore starts *before* the
//! installer init container. If its budget started immediately it could
//! expire while the installer was still working, delete this generation's
//! staged state, and then watch the installer publish a conflist nothing was
//! left to remove — manufacturing exactly the stranded chain the watcher
//! exists to prevent.
//!
//! So the run has two phases with distinct ownership:
//!
//! 1. **Publication.** Poll until the generated conflist carries *this*
//!    owner and generation. That file is written last and atomically, so its
//!    presence is the only observable proof that the install completed and
//!    the node now depends on the node-agent. An installer that never
//!    publishes never created a dependency, so there is nothing to roll back
//!    and the watcher reports [`RollbackWatchOutcome::NeverPublished`].
//! 2. **Readiness.** Only now does the budget start, and only now is STATUS
//!    probed at all. A STATUS answer observed *before* publication says
//!    nothing about this generation — the socket path is node-scoped and a
//!    previous node-agent generation can still be answering on it — so
//!    treating it as readiness would permanently disarm the rollback for a
//!    chain that had not been written yet.
//!
//! Cleanup additionally takes the node's install lock
//! ([`crate::cni::install::INSTALL_LOCK_FILE_NAME`]) for its whole run, and
//! re-reads the ownership markers under that lock, so it cannot interleave
//! with a still-running installer at all — and re-verifies the exact
//! device/inode it is about to unlink.
//!
//! Time only decides *when* to act. What may be removed is decided by the
//! ownership evidence written at install: the watcher pins both the owner and
//! the install generation, so a slow start that is overtaken by a newer
//! install (a rollout, an upgrade) can never delete the newer generation's
//! artifacts — that run reports `retained-other-generation` instead.
