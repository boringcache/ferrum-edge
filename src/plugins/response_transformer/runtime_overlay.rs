//! RTDS overlay consumer for the `response_transformer` plugin.

//! Reserved keys (per opt-in scope `<scope>`):
//!
//! - `ferrum.response_transformer.<scope>.enabled` → `Bool`
//!
//! Mirrors the `request_transformer` overlay consumer
//! ([`crate::plugins::request_transformer::runtime_overlay`]) — the two
//! plugins maintain independent gate maps so an operator can disable one
//! direction without affecting the other. As on the request side, the gate that
//! actually governs rule application is bound into the candidate instance
//! config on the cold path and published with its `RequestEpoch`
//! (GHSA-83rc-23c9-3g9x); this store is provenance only.
