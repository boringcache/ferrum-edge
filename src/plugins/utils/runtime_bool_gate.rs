//! Shared process-global boolean gate storage for RTDS overlay consumers.
//!
//! Plugins own their static store and key namespace, but the cold-path
//! mechanics are identical: rebuild a `HashMap<String, bool>` from a
//! [`MeshRuntimeOverlay`], publish it through `ArcSwap`, and let hot paths read
//! a cheap snapshot.
//!
//! ## Gate provenance
//!
//! A consumer whose gate decision shapes a representation that outlives the
//! request (`response_caching` storing a `response_transformer` output, or
//! `request_deduplication` persisting an idempotent replay) must know which
//! exact publication produced those bytes. The gate map and an opaque
//! [`GatePolicyStamp`] are therefore published together in one ArcSwap state. A
//! reader can never observe a new map paired with an old stamp (or the
//! inverse), and pointer identity cannot collide or wrap like an integer
//! generation counter.
//!
//! The stamp carries two distinct identities for two distinct questions:
//!
//! - [`GatePolicyStamp`] equality is **allocation identity**. Two publications
//!   are never equal, so an in-process consumer that must retire anything
//!   produced before *any* republication (including an A→B→A cycle observed
//!   mid-request) gets a conservative answer.
//! - `GatePolicyStamp::fingerprint` is a **content** digest of the published
//!   map. Two processes that published equivalent gate content derive the same
//!   value, which is what a representation persisted to a shared store
//!   (Redis) must be compared against — a pointer identity is meaningless
//!   outside the process that minted it.
