//! RTDS overlay consumer for the `request_transformer` plugin.
//!
//! Reserved keys (per opt-in scope `<scope>`):
//!
//! - `ferrum.request_transformer.<scope>.enabled` → `Bool`
//!
//! Plugin behaviour: when `runtime_overlay_scope: "<scope>"` is set on a
//! `request_transformer` instance, the accepted overlay's gate for that scope
//! is folded into the instance's own configuration on the mesh cold path
//! ([`scope_gates`] + [`crate::plugins::utils::transformer_gate::materialize_resolved_gate`]).
//! A `false` value short-circuits header, query, and body rule application; a
//! `true` value applies the rules normally. A scope the accepted overlay does
//! not name falls back to `default_enabled` from plugin config (defaults to
//! `true` so adding RTDS support is fail-open).
//!
//! The gate is therefore published in the same `RequestEpoch` as the rules it
//! gates and resolved once, immutably, at plugin construction — the request
//! path performs no overlay lookup at all (GHSA-83rc-23c9-3g9x). The
//! process-global store below is retained for provenance/observability only:
//! `response_caching` and `request_deduplication` bind representations they
//! retain to the response-side publication identity, and both stores keep
//! publishing post-accept so that provenance stays available. Nothing
//! behavioral reads them.
