//! Reusable, plugin-agnostic notification infrastructure.
//!
//! Provides:
//! - [`Notification`] — generic notification payload (title, body, severity,
//!   k/v fields, lifecycle action). No alert-specific fields.
//! - [`NotificationChannel`] — Slack / Teams / Discord / generic Webhook /
//!   SMTP email transport implementations sharing a uniform `dispatch` surface.
//! - [`channels::parse_channels`] — JSON-driven config parser used by any
//!   subsystem that wants to expose a `channels: { name -> def }` block to
//!   operators.
//! - [`templating`] — `${var}` substitution with dry-run validation.
//! - [`dispatch`] — bounded-concurrency fire-and-forget fan-out.
//!
//! The first consumer is the `proxy_alerts` plugin
//! (`src/plugins/proxy_alerts/`); future consumers (overload manager, mesh
//! policy enforcement, custom plugins) should depend on this module rather
//! than re-implementing channel formatters.
