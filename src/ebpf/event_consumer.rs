//! Userspace consumer for the SOCK_OPS ringbuf.
//!
//! The kernel-side `BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCK_OPS` program emits TCP lifecycle and
//! handshake records, the SK_SKB parser emits captured accept-to-first-byte,
//! and connect4/connect6 emit BPF drop-reason records. Userspace polls the
//! shared ringbuf, decodes records, and updates [`BpfMetricsState`].
//!
//! ## Production wiring (GAP-3D)
//!
//! The kernel-side `BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCK_OPS` program is loaded and pinned
//! by the node-agent (`src/ebpf/loader.rs::attach_sock_ops`). The mesh
//! proxy opens the pinned ringbuf at
//! [`BPF_SOCK_OPS_EVENTS_PIN_PATH`](crate::ebpf::BPF_SOCK_OPS_EVENTS_PIN_PATH)
//! and runs [`run_pinned_consumer`] as a background task that:
//!   1. Drives the kernel ringbuf with `tokio::io::unix::AsyncFd`, draining
//!      the records the kernel has published on each wakeup — and nothing
//!      past the producer position, which is what keeps a record from being
//!      counted twice (see [`RingBufCursor`] and issue #5563). Each wakeup
//!      is bounded by [`RINGBUF_DRAIN_RECORD_BUDGET`]; a pass that hits the
//!      budget retains ringbuf readiness instead of clearing it, so the
//!      drain resumes immediately while the other `select!` arms still get
//!      a turn.
//!   2. Decodes each record via [`SockOpsEvent::from_record_bytes`] and
//!      hands it to [`SockOpsConsumer::handle_event`].
//!   3. Queues first-data SockHash removal behind a bounded grace period, so
//!      ringbuf visibility cannot race the still-running parser/verdict callback.
//!   4. Polls the per-CPU dropped-events counter
//!      ([`BPF_SOCK_OPS_STATS_PIN_PATH`](crate::ebpf::BPF_SOCK_OPS_STATS_PIN_PATH))
//!      after each drain. When the sum advances, the consumer is in an
//!      overrun regime; [`SockOpsConsumer::record_overrun`] handles the
//!      warn/recover state machine so the log line never spams.
//!   5. Polls the per-CPU capture-bypass counters in the same stats map on a
//!      wall-clock timer and publishes their deltas. Those slots — not the
//!      `SOCK_OPS_EVENT_DROP_REASON` ringbuf records — are the accounting
//!      authority for `ferrum_mesh_bpf_drops_total`: a full ring discards the
//!      record while the kernel slot still moves, so counting records lost
//!      bypass classifications exactly when the node was busiest.
//!
//! On Linux `ebpf` builds, [`run_pinned_consumer`] waits for the
//! node-agent pins with capped exponential backoff (1s → 30s) and
//! attaches when they appear; it returns only on shutdown or an
//! unrecoverable attach error. The first miss logs one `info!` line.
//! Non-Linux / non-`ebpf` builds never start this task. The
//! [`BpfMetricsState`] stays at zero until maps appear — the
//! `__mesh_bpf_metrics` plugin still emits a stable Prometheus surface so
//! dashboards do not break.
