//! Node-waypoint identity resolution.
//!
//! In node-waypoint topology one proxy listener accepts traffic for many pods.
//! The node-agent/eBPF side records the socket cookie, original destination,
//! and source pod identity. The proxy resolves that cookie at accept time and
//! rejects unknown cookies before the request enters the plugin chain.
//!
//! ## Hot-path contract
//!
//! The resolver is consulted once per inbound TCP accept on a node-waypoint
//! listener (see `run_accept_loop` in `src/proxy/mod.rs`). The cost budget per
//! accept is:
//!
//! 1. One `getsockopt(SO_COOKIE)` (~50 ns) via [`socket_cookie`].
//! 2. One `DashMap::get` against the unified cookie record map (returns
//!    `(pod_uid, workload_spiffe_hash)`).
//! 3. One `DashMap::get` against the identity map (returns `Arc<NodeWaypointIdentity>`).
//! 4. One `ArcSwap::load` + `HashMap` lookup against the slice's
//!    `workload_spiffe_hash` index, re-validating that the control plane still
//!    vouches for the resolved workload (fail closed if it was removed). No
//!    allocation; the same loaded snapshot serves the cached and lazy-enrollment
//!    branches.
//! 5. One `Arc::clone` (~5 ns) to hand the identity to the connection task.
//!
//! Both hot-path DashMaps are sized via `crate::util::sharding::pool_shard_amount`
//! so contention scales with `num_cpus`. New accept-path atomics (per-reason
//! `node_waypoint_*_drops` counters in `OverloadState`) are `CachePadded` —
//! see `src/overload.rs`.
//!
//! Per-pod policy scope lookup is a separate HTTP request-path read:
//! one `ArcSwap::load` plus one `HashMap::get` when mesh authz stamps
//! node-waypoint request context. Scope rebuilds happen on slice apply and
//! identity enrollment, not in the accept loop.
//!
//! Linux socket cookies are unique across the IPv4/IPv6 protocol families, so
//! both address families share a single cookie record map; this avoids the
//! wasted IPv4 lookup that a dual-map design imposed on every IPv6 accept.
//! The original-destination address and port are intentionally NOT surfaced
//! by [`resolve_cookie`] / [`resolve_stream`] — production callers consume
//! only the resolved [`NodeWaypointIdentity`].
//!
//! [`socket_cookie`]: crate::socket_opts::socket_cookie
//!
//! ## Cgroup-inode lifecycle binding (GAP-2M.5)
//!
//! Pods get evicted, restarted, or rescheduled all the time. The kubelet
//! creates a fresh cgroup directory for every pod instance, so a pod restart
//! is observable as a cgroup-inode change at the same path. The resolver
//! optionally binds each enrolled identity to a cgroup v2 path captured at
//! enrollment time (`upsert_identity_with_cgroup`). Enrollment stores the
//! inode plus a small metadata fingerprint so inode reuse does not mask pod
//! restarts. A periodic sweep task (driven by
//! `FERRUM_MESH_NODE_WAYPOINT_CGROUP_SWEEP_INTERVAL_SECS`) re-stats those
//! paths and evicts identities whose fingerprint no longer matches (pod
//! restarted under the same UID) or whose path is gone (pod removed), so a
//! fresh enrollment from the control plane / eBPF side is required before
//! traffic for the new pod instance is honoured. Identities enrolled without
//! a cgroup path are kept indefinitely — the sweep is a best-effort
//! garbage-collection pass, not a security invariant. The fail-closed
//! invariant on the accept path is unchanged: an unknown cookie or pod is
//! still rejected before traffic enters the plugin chain.
