//! In-memory bounded ring of recent `mesh_authz` deny events used by the
//! `GET /mesh/policy-denies/recent` admin endpoint.
//!
//! ## Hot-path invariant
//!
//! Mesh request processing is dominated by the **allow** path; a deny is an
//! exception, not steady state. The recorder is therefore deliberately
//! `std::sync::Mutex`-backed and grabbed only when `mesh_authz` decides to
//! reject a request (HTTP/H3/gRPC/HBONE) or terminate a stream connection.
//! No code on the allow path touches the recorder. The lock is held for a
//! handful of operations (push to ring + drop oldest if full), so even on a
//! deny burst the contention envelope is small.
//!
//! The admin query path filters by `at >= now - window`, groups by the
//! `(rule, source, destination, reason)` tuple, then sorts by count
//! descending (tie-breaking on `last_at` descending) and truncates to
//! `limit`. This is a cold path — admin operators poll at human cadence.
