//! Stock Envoy / third-party Istio ADS consumer
//! (`FERRUM_MESH_CONFIG_PROTOCOL=stock_xds`, issue #3317).
//!
//! This is a **separate protocol** from `FERRUM_MESH_CONFIG_PROTOCOL=xds`, not
//! a mode of it. The Ferrum-private xDS client in [`super::xds_client`] keeps
//! its name-only resource shapes, its `ferrum.config.extension.v3.*` ECDS
//! carriers, and its required-type version-coherence gate; nothing here reaches
//! into that path, and a stock control plane can never drive it.
//!
//! ## Split of authority
//!
//! * The stock control plane is a **discovery** authority. It supplies standard
//!   v3 CDS/EDS/LDS/RDS, which [`crate::xds::stock`] projects onto
//!   `MeshConfig.services` and `MeshConfig.workloads`.
//! * Ferrum's **local mesh policy document** (`FERRUM_MESH_FILE_CONFIG_PATH`)
//!   is the **policy** authority. Authorization policies, PeerAuthentication,
//!   RequestAuthentication, trust bundles, DestinationRules, Sidecar scope, and
//!   ProxyConfig all come from there and are re-read on SIGHUP.
//!
//! That split is the whole security story: a third-party CP that Ferrum does
//! not otherwise trust can add or remove *reachability*, but it can never
//! author or weaken Ferrum's enforcement posture. The startup check refuses a
//! policy document that declares `services` or `workloads` so the two
//! authorities cannot silently overlap.
//!
//! ## Protocol behaviour
//!
//! State-of-the-world ADS with per-type nonces, ACK/NACK with field-specific
//! error details, dependency-ordered subscriptions (EDS follows the accepted
//! CDS clusters, RDS follows the accepted LDS listeners), wholesale replacement
//! of the complete-state types (CDS/LDS) with subscription-pruned merging for
//! the by-name types (EDS/RDS, whose responses may be partial) so deletions
//! propagate without a partial push blackholing untouched services, debounced
//! make-before-break publication through `MeshRuntimeState::install_slice`, a
//! consecutive-NACK circuit breaker, jittered backoff, and multi-server
//! failover. Unlike the Ferrum profile there is no cross-type
//! version-coherence gate: a stock CP versions each type independently and
//! carries no Ferrum security carriers that a skew could leave stale.
//!
//! Ferrum NEVER mints a Ferrum CP/DP JWT for a stock control plane. The only
//! credential it will present is an externally issued bearer token the operator
//! points at with `FERRUM_MESH_STOCK_XDS_TOKEN_FILE` (typically a projected
//! Kubernetes service-account token); with no token file configured the stream
//! carries no `authorization` metadata and relies on gRPC TLS alone.
//!
//! ## Transport and credential admission
//!
//! Two fail-closed boundaries wrap that credential:
//!
//! * [`super::stock_xds_transport`] (issue #3853) admits the COMPLETE
//!   primary/fallback endpoint set as one security posture before any socket is
//!   opened, and the `authorization` interceptor below re-checks the selected
//!   endpoint's classification at the insertion boundary so a bearer can never
//!   ride an unauthenticated channel even if top-level admission were bypassed.
//! * [`super::stock_xds_credential`] (issue #3852) gives the stream a finite
//!   local authorization lifetime: the source is watched for rotation and
//!   invalidation, and every stream carries a deadline derived from a bounded
//!   local `exp` hint or the operator-visible maximum stream lifetime.
//!
//! Attempt classification, endpoint rotation, backoff, and transport keepalive
//! are the shared [`super::stream_lifecycle`] policy (issue #3854).
//!
//! ## Log redaction
//!
//! A bearer-authenticated stock control plane sees the Authorization metadata
//! and can copy that bearer into any ADS response field. Ferrum logs on this
//! path therefore carry only closed-set type labels (`cds`/`eds`/`lds`/`rds`/
//! `sds`/`unsolicited`/`policy_reload`), fixed reason codes, counts, booleans,
//! endpoint indexes, and local node/namespace fields. Remote `type_url`,
//! `version_info`, `nonce`, resource names, NACK error text, and refusal
//! detail are omitted. Truncation is not redaction; NACK `error_detail` may
//! still return a bounded copy of the CP's own fields to that same CP.
