//! Shared mesh configuration-stream attempt and liveness policy (issue #3854).
//!
//! The three mesh configuration consumers — native `MeshSubscribe`
//! ([`super::native_client`]), the Ferrum-private ADS profile
//! ([`super::xds_client`]), and the third-party stock ADS profile
//! ([`super::stock_xds_client`]) — previously each classified a stream ending
//! and each built its own tonic endpoint. They drifted into the same two
//! defects:
//!
//! 1. A remote clean EOF (`Ok(None)` from `message()`) was treated as a
//!    *successful* attempt: backoff reset to the initial delay and the client
//!    stayed on (or returned to) the primary endpoint. A primary that accepts
//!    the RPC and immediately closes therefore pinned the client in a
//!    primary-only hot loop and a healthy fallback was never consulted.
//! 2. The endpoints configured only a **connect** timeout. Once established,
//!    a half-open or blackholed transport left `message().await` pending
//!    forever, so failover never happened and stale mesh state kept serving.
//!
//! This module is the one policy both halves now share. It is deliberately free
//! of gRPC/runtime I/O beyond building a tonic [`Endpoint`], so the
//! classification table is unit-testable without standing up a control plane.
//!
//! ## What is *not* shared
//!
//! Partial-state semantics stay per protocol. The native consumer publishes one
//! whole slice per frame; the two ADS consumers accumulate independent typed
//! responses and only publish once their own required-type gate is satisfied.
//! Nothing here decides when a slice may be built — it decides only what a
//! *stream attempt outcome* means for endpoint rotation and backoff.
