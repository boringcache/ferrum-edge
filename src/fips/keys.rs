//! Approved key strengths and forms for operator-controlled key material.
//!
//! # Why this exists separately from the provider
//!
//! Selecting the AWS-LC FIPS module decides *which implementation* computes a
//! signature. It does not, on its own, decide which **keys** Ferrum will agree
//! to serve with. Those are two different gates, and only one of them is the
//! provider's:
//!
//! - The rustls FIPS provider does reject a non-approved *algorithm* — it will
//!   not negotiate a suite, group, or signature scheme outside the approved
//!   set, and `fips::policy::check_tls_policy` re-asserts that over the
//!   constructed policy.
//! - It does **not** uniformly reject an approved algorithm used with an
//!   under-strength key. An RSA-1024 leaf certificate is `rsaEncryption` with
//!   `rsa_pkcs1_sha256`, both nominally approved; SP 800-131A Rev. 2 disallows
//!   the 1024-bit *key*, not the scheme. Depending on the construction path
//!   that key can reach a handshake, or it can fail later with an opaque
//!   provider error that names nothing the operator can act on.
//!
//! So this module is the Ferrum-enforced half, applied at admission: at the
//! single PEM certificate-loading boundary
//! ([`crate::tls::parse_pem_certificate_bundle`]) and at the JWKS key-admission
//! boundary. Both are construction/reload paths, never the request hot path.
//!
//! # What is checked, and on what material
//!
//! Only **public** key material is inspected: the `SubjectPublicKeyInfo` of a
//! certificate, or the public components of a JWK. Private keys keep flowing
//! through the existing secure loading boundary
//! ([`crate::tls::parse_pem_private_key`]) untouched — this module never parses,
//! copies, or logs private-key bytes. That is deliberate: a private key's
//! strength is pinned by the certificate it is paired with, so the public side
//! is both sufficient and the safe place to look.
//!
//! # Diagnostics
//!
//! Every diagnostic names the fixed Ferrum surface label, the key algorithm
//! family, and the observed strength in bits. It never interpolates a file
//! path, a URL, a subject name, or any key bytes. The surface label is bounded
//! to [`MAX_SURFACE_LABEL_CHARS`] because a few callers derive it from a
//! configuration-supplied source kind.
