/// `resolve_all_env_secrets` is still running, so it precedes the point where a
/// `FERRUM_CONF_PATH_FILE` is materialized into `FERRUM_CONF_PATH` — priming the
/// cache here would silently pin the default/discovered settings file for the
/// rest of the process and make `validate`/`run` ignore the externally resolved
/// settings path. Any `_GCP` secret at all is enough to trigger it, because the
/// client is built before the first fetch.
