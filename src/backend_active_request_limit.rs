//! Destination-wide **active-request** circuit breaker for HTTP-family backend
//! dispatch.
//!
//! Enforces Istio DestinationRule `connectionPool.http.http2MaxRequests`:
//!
//! > Maximum number of active requests to a destination. Applicable to both
//! > HTTP1.1 and HTTP2.
//!
//! and its Envoy equivalent, the cluster circuit breaker
//! `thresholds[].max_requests` (maximum parallel requests to an upstream
//! cluster). It is **not** an HTTP/2 transport setting: Istio's neighbouring
//! `connectionPool.http.maxConcurrentStreams` is the per-connection HTTP/2
//! stream control, which Ferrum maps separately onto
//! `Proxy.pool_http2_max_concurrent_streams` and the hyper
//! `http2::Builder::max_concurrent_streams` / `initial_max_send_streams` knobs
//! (see [`crate::config::types::UpstreamPortOverride`]).
//!
//! # Why a gateway-side counter and not SETTINGS
//!
//! A per-connection stream cap cannot express this field:
//!
//! * HTTP/1.1 has no stream concept at all, yet the Istio field explicitly
//!   applies to it.
//! * Every physical H2/gRPC connection — and every pool shard — is built with
//!   its own allowance, so `N` connections admit `N × cap` requests.
//! * Peer SETTINGS replace the local initial bound, so the operator's ceiling is
//!   not durable.
//! * `max_concurrent_streams` on a server builder also describes streams the
//!   *peer* may open toward Ferrum, which is not an outbound request budget.
//!
//! The authoritative budget therefore lives here: one shared counter per
//! logical destination, consulted by every HTTP-family upstream attempt before
//! backend dispatch, and released only when that attempt's
//! request/response exchange is completely over.
//!
//! # Scope key — logical destination, not socket address
//!
//! The lane is keyed by the **effective policy identity** of the destination:
//!
//! ```text
//! <namespace>|<logical destination>|<policy port>|<subset>
//! ```
//!
//! * `namespace` isolates tenants.
//! * `logical destination` is the referenced upstream id (the Kubernetes
//!   Service / DestinationRule cluster) when the proxy has one, else the proxy
//!   id for a direct-backend route. It deliberately is **not** the resolved
//!   backend host/IP: Envoy's breaker is per cluster, so every endpoint of one
//!   destination shares one budget, and two Services that happen to resolve to
//!   the same pods keep independent budgets (issue #3778's logical-scope
//!   contract, which this module is compatible with but does not depend on).
//! * `policy port` is the DestinationRule policy port
//!   (`dispatch_policy_port_for_target`), so a `targetPort` remap does not split
//!   one destination's budget and an explicit `portLevelSettings[{port}]` cap is
//!   visible to every frontend.
//! * `subset` is the selected DestinationRule subset (`None` is a distinct lane
//!   from every named subset), length-prefixed so a hostile subset name cannot
//!   collide with a sibling lane.
//!
//! The lane is deliberately stable across config generations. A reload must
//! not mint a fresh allowance while requests admitted by the previous config
//! are still active: every acquire applies the current cap to the shared count.
//! Lowering a cap therefore sheds until the count drains below the new value;
//! raising it takes effect immediately; removing a cap stops new acquisitions
//! while existing guards keep the lane counted; and re-adding it cannot ignore
//! those guards. A lane is evicted the moment its count returns to zero, so
//! service/subset churn cannot grow the map without bound.
//!
//! # Lifetime — the whole exchange, not the headers
//!
//! The permit is acquired during backend admission (before any backend socket
//! is dialed or any byte is sent) and is carried as an owned RAII guard by the
//! response body, so it is released exactly once on every terminal path:
//! buffered completion, streamed body EOF, gRPC trailers, client disconnect,
//! backend reset/GOAWAY, deadline, task cancellation, and graceful shutdown.
//! Releasing at response headers would leave a streaming or long-lived gRPC
//! response uncounted while it still occupies backend capacity — the exact
//! failure the Istio field exists to prevent.
//!
//! A sequential retry is a new active request: the previous attempt's permit is
//! released before the next attempt acquires, and concurrently-active attempts
//! each hold their own permit.
//!
//! # Overflow behaviour
//!
//! A saturated destination sheds the request **before** a backend attempt
//! exists: no dial, no bytes, no backend signal. The rejection is therefore
//! classified as a gateway-side policy overload (HTTP 503, gRPC `UNAVAILABLE`
//! through the existing admission-rejection shaping) and is neutral to passive
//! health, the circuit breaker, and adaptive concurrency. Nothing is queued
//! behind the limiter.
//!
//! # Hot-path discipline (mirrors [`crate::backend_pending_limit`])
//!
//! * No configured cap (`cap == None`) returns `Ok(None)` after one `Option`
//!   check and never touches the `DashMap`.
//! * The capped hit path builds its key into a reused thread-local `String` and
//!   looks the lane up by borrowed `&str` (`String: Borrow<str>`), so a repeat
//!   request to a known destination allocates nothing. Only the cold first
//!   request for a lane allocates the owned key.
//! * The map is a sharded [`dashmap::DashMap`] sized by
//!   [`crate::util::sharding::pool_shard_amount`]; each counter is
//!   [`crossbeam_utils::CachePadded`] so a hot destination does not false-share.
//! * Check-and-reserve happens **together under the shard lock**, and the
//!   drop-time decrement + at-zero eviction run in one `remove_if` under that
//!   same lock, so an acquirer can never resurrect an orphaned counter (cap
//!   bypass) nor strand a zero-count lane.
//!
//! # Observability
//!
//! Fixed-cardinality process totals only ([`render_prometheus`]): active
//! permits, admitted total, and rejected total. Raw Service / subset / host /
//! namespace identity is deliberately never a metric label — it is unbounded
//! operator-controlled input. A lock-free gateway-wide limiter bounds the
//! rejection summary to one line per second and reports the suppressed count.
