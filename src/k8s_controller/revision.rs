//! Authoritative mesh config revisions for a Kubernetes-controller control
//! plane (issue #3611).
//!
//! `modes::mesh::revision` orders mesh slices by `(authority, sequence)` and
//! quarantines a fallback control plane whose sequence is behind the accepted
//! one. A DB-backed CP feeds that gate from its store's durable
//! `config_changes` cursor. A CP running the Kubernetes CRD controller had no
//! sequence at all, so it published no revision and the gate stayed inert in
//! exactly the multi-replica topology the mesh charts deploy. This module
//! supplies the missing sequence.
//!
//! # What the sequence has to be
//!
//! Two CP replicas watching the same Kubernetes API server must publish
//! sequences that are *comparable* (same number space), *shared* (derived from
//! cluster state, not from either process), and *monotonic* (never rewinding
//! inside one authority). Only one value in the Kubernetes API satisfies all
//! three: the `resourceVersion`, which on every etcd-backed API server is the
//! cluster-global etcd revision. It is minted by the store, identical for every
//! client, and never reused or decreased for the life of the cluster.
//!
//! What is emphatically NOT usable:
//!
//! * **max over live object metadata.** Deleting the highest-versioned object in
//!   a scope *lowers* that maximum. A replica that restarts after such a
//!   deletion relists, recomputes a lower maximum, and publishes a revision
//!   below the one its still-running peer already published — a rewind inside
//!   one authority, which the data-plane gate never auto-adopts. In a quiet
//!   namespace it would need an operator reset to recover.
//! * **a wall clock or a process-local counter.** Neither is shared, and the
//!   gate exists precisely because `MeshSlice.version` (a CP-local timestamp)
//!   was not.
//! * **the current cluster revision read at reconcile time.** It says what the
//!   cluster is at, not what this replica's reflectors have converged through.
//!   A stalled watcher would make it claim freshness it does not have.
//!
//! # Evidence, not optimism
//!
//! The tracker keeps, per watch scope, the highest revision that scope is
//! *proven* converged through. Two kinds of evidence establish it:
//!
//! * **A boundary read** taken immediately BEFORE a watcher generation starts.
//!   kube-rs consumes list metadata and watch bookmarks internally and surfaces
//!   neither ([`kube::runtime::watcher::Event`] has no bookmark variant), so the
//!   generation's own list revision is unavailable. Instead the caller performs
//!   a one-item consistent list on the same resource and scope; whatever
//!   revision it returns is necessarily ≤ the revision of the generation's own
//!   list, because `watcher::Config` defaults to
//!   [`kube::runtime::watcher::ListSemantic::MostRecent`] — an unset
//!   `resourceVersion`, i.e. a quorum read at the *current* etcd revision, which
//!   is ≥ every revision any client has already observed. The boundary is
//!   adopted only when that generation reports `InitDone`, at which point its
//!   store holds a list computed at or after the boundary.
//! * **Observed watch events.** A watch resumed from a list revision delivers
//!   every change in order, so having processed an event stamped `r` proves the
//!   scope has seen everything up to `r`. Deletions count: a `DELETED` watch
//!   event carries the object stamped with the *deletion* revision, so a
//!   deletion advances the watermark instead of lowering it.
//!
//! Listed objects are held back until `InitDone` because the reflector buffers
//! an initial list and commits it atomically at that event. Advancing on an
//! object the store has not yet published would claim convergence the snapshot
//! does not have.
//!
//! # The coherence point
//!
//! A reconcile snapshot is the union of independently converging scopes, so it
//! is not a coherent cluster snapshot at any single revision. The strongest true
//! statement is: *it contains every change up to the MINIMUM of its scopes'
//! watermarks* (and possibly some later ones). That minimum is therefore the
//! sequence, and the aggregation rules follow from it:
//!
//! * the scope set is pinned under the same `ResourceStoreSet` lock that
//!   materializes the snapshot, and the watermark is read BEFORE
//!   `snapshot_all()` — the stores can only move forward in between, so the
//!   snapshot is never older than the sequence claims;
//! * a registered scope with no evidence yet (initial list in flight, relist not
//!   finished, `resourceVersion` unparsable) makes the whole watermark
//!   unavailable — a snapshot missing a resource type must not be stamped as if
//!   it were complete;
//! * an unavailable watermark does not publish an unsequenced or optimistic
//!   frame. [`K8sConfigRevisionTracker::publish`] retains the last published
//!   sequence and refuses to advance. Divergent mesh evolved under that equal
//!   scalar is **not** broadcast: the reconciler publication boundary retains
//!   the last accepted mesh until the sequence can advance, so data planes see
//!   either an identical equal-revision replay or no mesh change at all — never
//!   a new snapshot stamped with the old scalar.
//!
//! # Refreshing evidence on demand
//!
//! The aggregate is a MINIMUM, so it is pinned by the QUIETEST scope, and a
//! quiet scope's watermark only moves when its watcher generation adopts a new
//! boundary — i.e. on a relist. Left to the idle relist alone
//! (`FERRUM_K8S_WATCH_IDLE_RELIST_SECS`, default 300 s), a change in ONE busy
//! scope therefore cannot advance the sequence, the publication boundary
//! retains the last accepted mesh, and mesh config propagation stalls for up to
//! a whole idle window on a perfectly healthy single-replica control plane.
//! That is not a theoretical bound: it reproduced as a ~350 s live-datapath
//! outage in the NodeWaypoint eBPF suite, where workloads created seconds after
//! startup did not reach any ambient proxy until the first idle relist.
//!
//! Nothing may be *assumed* about a quiet scope — the whole point of the
//! pre-list boundary is that convergence is proven, not optimistic — so the
//! repair is to ACQUIRE the missing proof instead of waiting for the timer:
//! [`K8sConfigRevisionTracker::request_evidence_refresh`] asks every watch scope
//! to start a fresh generation, which takes a new boundary read and adopts it at
//! `InitDone` exactly as the idle relist does. The publication boundary raises
//! the request only when it actually had to withhold changed mesh content, and
//! each scope's watcher spaces its refreshes with its own floor interval, so a
//! churning cluster cannot turn this into an unbounded list storm: the extra
//! cost is at most one relist sweep per floor interval, and only while mesh
//! content is being withheld — a state that is otherwise a config outage.
//!
//! # Monotonicity
//!
//! Per scope the watermark is a running maximum, so it never falls. The
//! aggregate minimum *can* fall when the scope set grows (a CRD installed later
//! adds a scope whose evidence is younger), so publication applies an in-process
//! floor — the same device the DB path uses — and never emits a sequence below
//! one it already published. Across a restart no floor is needed: a fresh
//! boundary read returns a current etcd revision, which is ≥ anything the
//! previous process could have observed.
//!
//! # Assumption, stated
//!
//! Kubernetes documents `resourceVersion` as opaque and does not guarantee
//! comparability across resource types. On every etcd-backed API server it is
//! the shared etcd revision, which is what makes a cross-type minimum
//! meaningful. The tracker therefore requires each value to parse as a `u64` and
//! treats anything else as *no evidence* — an API server whose versions are not
//! numeric produces no watermark and the CP publishes no advance, rather than
//! ordering on values it cannot interpret.
