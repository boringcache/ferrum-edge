//! Wall-clock budgets for Kubernetes status writes on the serialized reconcile
//! loop (issue #4239).
//!
//! Gateway API and Istio status patch batches are awaited *inline* on the single
//! reconcile task: while a batch runs, no watch event and no full-sync tick can
//! produce a new reconcile, so no other object's status can be published. Before
//! #4239 the only bound on that batch was a single 60-second whole-batch
//! timeout, and the individual API requests inside it were unbounded (the shared
//! kube client's read timeout is measured in minutes and cannot be lowered
//! without breaking the reflector watches that use the same client).
//!
//! One stalled status request therefore froze *all* reconciliation for a full 60
//! seconds — exactly the Gateway API conformance suite's own parent-status wait,
//! so any route created inside that window failed deterministically on whichever
//! arbitrary test happened to be running. Run 32913920801 shows the shape: a
//! reconcile with `elapsed_ms: 60036` around a `updates: 3` batch timeout, with
//! every neighbouring reconcile completing in 35–275 ms.
//!
//! The budgets here make the blockage bounded and attributable:
//!
//! * every individual API request is bounded by [`STATUS_REQUEST_BUDGET`],
//! * every object's whole read-modify-write is bounded by [`STATUS_UPDATE_BUDGET`],
//! * every batch is bounded by [`STATUS_BATCH_BUDGET`], which also clamps the
//!   two budgets above so a batch can never overrun by a whole request,
//! * [`STATUS_BATCH_BACKSTOP`] stays as a defensive outer timeout in the
//!   reconciler and should no longer be reachable.
//!
//! A budget expiry is *not* a lost write. The reconciler leaves the status-plan
//! cursor unchanged on any patch error, so the same bounded window is replanned
//! and retried on the next reconcile; objects that already succeeded drop out of
//! the plan, so the tail of a slow batch moves up rather than starving.
