//! NodeWaypoint UDP/DTLS **Service-path steering** (issue #3286).
//!
//! # The gap this closes
//!
//! Issue #3286's listeners are host-netns wildcard UDP/DTLS sockets, one per
//! in-mesh Service port. Materializing them makes the authorization *mechanism*
//! reachable, but nothing makes ORDINARY traffic reach it. Trace what a workload
//! actually does:
//!
//! 1. It resolves `svc.ns.svc.cluster.local` and sends a datagram to
//!    `<ClusterIP>:<port>`.
//! 2. The datagram leaves the pod netns and enters the host namespace on that
//!    pod's host-side veth. `cgroup/connect4`/`connect6` do NOT touch it — the
//!    outbound capture listener is TCP-only, so those hooks deliberately skip
//!    `SOCK_DGRAM` and the destination stays the ClusterIP.
//! 3. tc ingress on that veth sees a destination that is not an enrolled pod IP
//!    and passes it on.
//! 4. `nat PREROUTING` / kube-proxy DNATs the ClusterIP to a backing
//!    `podIP:targetPort` and the datagram is FORWARDED to that pod's veth.
//! 5. tc egress on the destination pod's veth finds an enrolled destination and
//!    an unmarked, non-DNS datagram — and DROPS it.
//!
//! So the Service path is not merely a bypass of the waypoint; with the relay
//! auth mark configured it is a black hole. Only a direct dial to a *node*
//! address ever reached the materialized listener.
//!
//! # The steering, in one sentence
//!
//! On each enrolled pod's host-side interface, exempt that pod's datagrams to a
//! materialized Service `(ClusterIP, port)` from conntrack, mark them, and route
//! marked datagrams to a `local` table — so the datagram is delivered to the
//! waypoint's own socket **with its original destination still in the IP
//! header**, before kube-proxy can DNAT it.
//!
//! See `crate::capture::node_waypoint_udp_steer_setup_script` for the exact rule
//! shape and why each element is required. The properties that matter here:
//!
//! * **Evidence is preserved, not synthesized.** Nothing is rewritten, so the
//!   source address is still the pod's, the ingress interface is still the pod's
//!   veth, and `IP_PKTINFO`/`IPV6_PKTINFO` reports the ClusterIP as the local
//!   address. That is precisely the evidence
//!   [`crate::proxy::node_waypoint_udp_identity`] already attributes from, and
//!   the reply source the UDP session pins.
//! * **Service identity is part of the match.** Rules are scoped
//!   `-d <ClusterIP> --dport <port>`, never by port alone: a workload's datagram
//!   to an unrelated off-cluster host that happens to share a port number is not
//!   steered, and a materialized listener can only ever receive the Service it
//!   was materialized for (one service per port is already enforced at
//!   materialization — two claimants refuse BOTH).
//! * **No recursion.** The match is `-i <pod veth>` in `PREROUTING`. The
//!   waypoint's own relay dials and replies are locally generated and traverse
//!   `OUTPUT`, which is never hooked, so they are structurally incapable of
//!   being steered back into the waypoint.
//! * **No plaintext lane.** When steering is absent (never published, refused,
//!   or torn down) the datagram takes the pre-existing path and is dropped by
//!   the pod-veth guard. Losing steering loses the service, it does not open an
//!   unauthorized one.
//! * **The direct-pod guard is untouched.** No rule here admits anything to a
//!   pod; steering only diverts traffic to a local socket.
//!
//! # Ownership and lifecycle
//!
//! Mesh config preparation may *derive* the desired destination set and carry
//! it as candidate metadata. It must not publish the live datapath: preparation
//! is not commit, and read-only callers reach the same materializer. The
//! serving [`NodeWaypointUdpSteering`] instance owns the bound destination set
//! and is updated only from the accepted serving generation, and only for
//! destinations whose UDP/DTLS listeners are actually bound
//! (`StreamListenerManager`). The interface set is the EXACT set of interfaces
//! the source-attribution index successfully published this pass
//! (`NodeWaypointUdpSourceIndex::publish` → `PublishedSourceGeneration::ifaces`),
//! not the planner's pre-publication wish list: publication is where a
//! contested interface refuses every claimant, a malformed or UID-mismatched
//! binding is dropped, and an over-bound input collapses to an empty
//! generation. Steering an interface publication refused would divert its
//! datagrams to a listener that could only deny them.
//!
//! The same serving generation also drives the **reply-source authorization**
//! this steering makes necessary (see
//! [`crate::proxy::node_waypoint_udp_reply_source`]). Steering preserves the
//! ClusterIP as the datagram's local address, so the listener's reply is pinned
//! to it — and a ClusterIP is not a configured node IP, so `tc_inbound` would
//! drop that reply without an exact `(address, port)` authorization. The two
//! halves move together inside one critical section: on apply the sources are
//! authorized BEFORE the rules exist, on teardown they are withdrawn AFTER the
//! rules are gone, and a failure in either half tears the whole generation down
//! rather than leaving a steered-but-unanswerable or authorized-but-unserved
//! datapath.
//!
//! # Publishing is not applying: the acknowledgement gate
//!
//! The proxy does not write BPF maps — the node-agent does, on its own poll. So
//! "the claim is published" is not evidence that "the map holds it", and the
//! interval between the two is precisely the steered-but-unanswerable window
//! that the Service-path black hole is made of. A node-agent that is wedged,
//! restarting, missing a map, or refusing the set would leave a new generation's
//! rules installed indefinitely against a guard that drops every reply.
//!
//! So a reconcile installs setup rules only after the node-agent has
//! acknowledged THAT EXACT generation
//! ([`crate::proxy::node_waypoint_udp_reply_source::ReplySourceGeneration`]).
//! Until then the outcome is [`SteerReconcileOutcome::PendingAck`], the rules
//! stay (or are put back) absent, and the pass returns immediately — the retry
//! is the next ordinary reconcile tick, never a sleep, a spin, or a blocked
//! runtime worker. The teardown side is symmetric: a withdrawal is not
//! [`SteerReconcileOutcome::Removed`] until the node-agent acknowledges the
//! EMPTY generation, and until then every pass re-publishes and re-checks. An
//! acknowledgement naming a different owner (a crashed predecessor) or a
//! different sequence (an earlier set, or a differently ordered rendering of
//! one) satisfies nothing.
//!
//! [`NodeWaypointUdpSteering::reconcile`] applies the pair only when it CHANGED,
//! tears the datapath down whenever either half is empty, ALWAYS runs one
//! exact-name teardown before this process trusts the datapath (so objects a
//! crashed prior process left installed are reaped on the first pass rather than
//! surviving until this process exits), and tears it down on drop (task abort or
//! panic included) so a dead reconcile loop cannot leave marked-but-unserved
//! destinations installed.
//!
//! Destination and interface updates share one cold-path mutex: each event
//! mutates only its component, then the backend reconcile derives from the
//! latest combined desired state inside that same critical section. A stale
//! cloned plan must never install after a newer event has already published.
//! The datagram hot path does not take this lock.
//!
//! Linux-only. Everywhere else [`NodeWaypointUdpSteering`] is inert and
//! `steering_supported()` is false, which is also why the mesh startup path
//! keeps its fail-closed UDP/DTLS suppression off Linux.
