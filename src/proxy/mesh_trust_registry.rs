//! Gateway-to-mesh transport ownership registry for live trust withdrawal
//! (issue #3859).
//!
//! Draining the HBONE / mesh-mTLS pool maps proves only that a *future* lookup
//! cannot discover a connection. It does not reach a connection whose handles
//! have already left the map: an issued [`super::hbone_pool::H2ConnectTunnel`]
//! owns its `RecvStream`/`SendStream` directly, a cloned HTTP/2 sender can open
//! fresh streams on the established TLS session, and the one-connection-per-
//! session WebSocket / datagram bridges were never in the map at all. After an
//! operator withdraws an X.509 / JWT authority, every one of those keeps
//! carrying traffic authenticated under the withdrawn root until its own EOF.
//!
//! This module owns the missing half: **connection ownership**. Every
//! gateway-to-mesh TLS transport — pooled or 1:1 — registers here when its
//! connection driver is spawned, under the accepted gateway trust generation,
//! and hands its driver task a [`MeshTransportGate`]. The gate stays reachable
//! after callers clone the sender or take the tunnel out of the pool, because
//! the handles carry a clone of it rather than a pool reference.
//!
//! # Withdrawal sequence
//!
//! [`MeshTrustRegistry::retire_for_trust_withdrawal`] runs, in order:
//!
//! 1. take the admission fence for write, so no dial in flight can register;
//! 2. publish the next accepted generation;
//! 3. mark the outgoing generation retired;
//! 4. synchronously signal every registered transport at or below it;
//! 5. release the registry fence, allowing registrations for the new ownership
//!    generation.
//!
//! The outer gateway-trust publication fence is separate and remains closed
//! across this sequence. The publication path installs the accepted verifier
//! **before** calling this method, so a dial that takes a ticket for the newly
//! published generation can only load that already-stored material. Releasing
//! this registry fence therefore does not reopen request admission early, and
//! it does not create a window of new-generation tickets authenticated by the
//! withdrawn verifier.
//!
//! Signalling is synchronous — the gate flag is set and the driver is notified
//! before the fence is released — so no transport can be admitted, returned to
//! a pool, or handed to a caller in the window between publication and
//! teardown. Completing the teardown (dropping the HTTP/2 connection, which
//! closes the socket and errors every stream on it) is a bounded task wake, not
//! an unbounded wait: it does not depend on peer behaviour, backend liveness,
//! or a drain timer.
//!
//! # Creation race
//!
//! A dial that started before the fence takes an [`MeshAdmissionTicket`] stamped
//! with the generation it dialled under. [`MeshTrustRegistry::register`] refuses
//! a ticket whose generation is no longer the accepted one, so a connection
//! established under withdrawn trust can neither be inserted into a pool nor be
//! returned to the caller — it fails closed instead of escaping retirement.
//!
//! # No churn
//!
//! Nothing here fires unless an accepted publication actually *removes* an
//! authority ([`trust_withdrawal_reason`]). An identical `Replace`, an additive
//! overlap, an `Unchanged` side channel, a redundant `Clear` with no installed
//! override, and every rejected candidate leave the generation, the registry,
//! and every live session untouched.
//!
//! # Disclosure
//!
//! Metrics are fixed-cardinality counters over a closed reason/transport set.
//! No trust material, certificate subject, key id, fingerprint, source path, or
//! peer identity is ever a label value, a sample value, a log field, or part of
//! the client-visible error string.
