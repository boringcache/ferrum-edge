//! Per-direction traffic-key confidentiality budget for kTLS sessions
//! (issue #3619).
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! rustls normally counts the messages each traffic key has protected and
//! refuses to keep going once the negotiated suite's
//! `CipherSuiteCommon::confidentiality_limit` is reached. Handing the keys to
//! the kernel with `dangerous_into_kernel_connection` ends that: the rustls
//! `kernel` module states plainly that a `KernelConnection` "has no way to
//! track this" and that tracking approximately how many messages have been
//! sent — and aborting before the limit — becomes the caller's job.
//!
//! In the pinned providers (`rustls 0.23.40`, aws-lc-rs and ring alike) the
//! TLS 1.2 AES-GCM suites carry `confidentiality_limit: 1 << 24` and
//! ChaCha20-Poly1305 carries `u64::MAX`. So an AES-GCM kTLS session must be
//! torn down before 2^24 records in **either** direction, while ChaCha keeps
//! its genuinely unlimited posture and pays nothing here.
//!
//! # Why plaintext byte counters are not a record bound
//!
//! A peer chooses its own record sizing. A hostile client can emit minimum- or
//! zero-length records, so "bytes relayed / 2^14" understates the record count
//! by an unbounded factor. The only trustworthy record counter is the kernel's
//! own: the TLS ULP keeps the live per-direction record sequence number in
//! `cipher_context.rec_seq` and returns it from
//! `getsockopt(SOL_TLS, TLS_TX | TLS_RX)`, already including whatever the
//! handshake consumed before handoff. [`crate::socket_opts::ktls::read_ktls_record_seq`]
//! reads and validates that value; this module decides when to read it and what
//! it means.
//!
//! # Why polling it is not a per-byte syscall
//!
//! Reading the counter before every relayed byte would be absurd, and reading
//! it once per `splice(2)` would still add a syscall to the hot path. Instead
//! the guard runs a **pre-charged watchdog**: before every relay syscall it
//! reserves that syscall's *pessimistic upper bound* on records out of the
//! remaining budget, and only when the reservation no longer fits does it pay
//! for a fresh kernel observation. Because the reservation happens **before**
//! the syscall, the true sequence number can never pass the threshold between
//! two observations:
//!
//! > `true_seq ≤ observed_seq + (charges since the observation) ≤ threshold`
//!
//! The two bounds are:
//!
//! * **Transmit** — [`transmit_record_bound`]. The kernel packs a write into
//!   at most `ceil(bytes / 2^14)` full records, plus one for a record left
//!   partially filled by an earlier write.
//! * **Receive** — [`receive_record_bound`]. One non-blocking receive can only
//!   consume records the kernel has already queued, and queued data is capped
//!   by the socket receive buffer, so the record count is capped by
//!   `receive-buffer-ceiling / minimum-record-wire-size`. The ceiling is taken
//!   from the live `SO_RCVBUF` **and** the kernel's `tcp_rmem` maximum, so
//!   receive-buffer autotuning during an observation window cannot invalidate
//!   the bound (see [`receive_buffer_ceiling`]).
//!
//! With a 6 MiB ceiling that is roughly one `getsockopt` per 70 splice calls,
//! and with a quiet socket it is one per several hundred megabytes.
//!
//! # Fail closed
//!
//! Every uncertainty ends the relay rather than relaxing the bound: an
//! unreadable or malformed kernel counter ([`KtlsConfidentialityError::Unobservable`]),
//! a counter that moves backwards ([`KtlsConfidentialityError::NonMonotonic`]),
//! a single observation window that cannot be proven to fit in the remaining
//! budget ([`KtlsConfidentialityError::WindowExceedsBudget`]), and of course
//! reaching the threshold itself ([`KtlsConfidentialityError::LimitReached`]).
//! Ciphers whose limit is enforceable are additionally refused *before the
//! handshake is consumed* when the kernel cannot expose the counter at all —
//! see `proxy::ktls_accept`.
