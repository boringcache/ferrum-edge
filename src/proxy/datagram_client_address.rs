//! Datagram-safe client-address metadata (PROXY protocol v2 DGRAM envelope).
//!
//! UDP and DTLS listeners behind a datagram load balancer only ever observe the
//! balancer's own socket address, so the original client identity is lost for
//! authorization, rate limiting, and audit. TCP solves this with the PROXY
//! protocol, but that framing is connection-borne: it is written once, ahead of
//! the byte stream, and nothing in it survives datagram boundaries.
//!
//! This module defines the datagram equivalent Ferrum accepts (issue #3289):
//! a PROXY protocol v2 header carrying the `DGRAM` transport byte, prepended to
//! **every** datagram, with the application payload following the declared
//! address block.
//!
//! ```text
//!  0                12      13      14          16
//!  +----------------+-------+-------+-----------+----------------+---------+
//!  | v2 signature   |ver_cmd|fam_tp | addr_len  |  address block | payload |
//!  |   (12 bytes)   |  1 B  |  1 B  |  u16 BE   |  addr_len B    |    …    |
//!  +----------------+-------+-------+-----------+----------------+---------+
//! ```
//!
//! Per-datagram (rather than first-datagram-only) framing is deliberate. A
//! session-scoped header would let any later datagram from the same 4-tuple
//! inherit an identity it never proved, and datagram delivery is unordered and
//! lossy, so there is no "first" datagram to rely on.
//!
//! # Three separate properties
//!
//! The authenticated envelope provides three *distinct* guarantees. Do not
//! conflate them, and do not weaken one on the strength of another:
//!
//! 1. **Authenticity** — the tag proves the envelope and payload were minted by
//!    a holder of `FERRUM_DATAGRAM_PROXY_PROTOCOL_SECRET`.
//! 2. **Listener-domain binding** (issue #3856) — the tag is computed over a
//!    versioned domain-separation prefix naming the *exact receiving listener*,
//!    so an envelope minted for listener A can never authenticate on listener B
//!    even though both key from one process-global root secret. This holds for
//!    every command and family, `LOCAL` and `AF_UNSPEC` included.
//! 3. **Freshness / anti-replay** (issue #3862) — an authenticated envelope
//!    carries a bounded, authenticated freshness record, and the receiver keeps
//!    a bounded sliding replay window per sender so each `(sender, epoch,
//!    sequence)` is admitted at most once.
//!
//! # Security model
//!
//! The mechanism is off unless an operator sets `stream_proxy_protocol: true`
//! on the `udp` / `dtls` proxy. When it is on:
//!
//! - The socket peer must be inside `FERRUM_TRUSTED_PROXIES`. An untrusted peer
//!   is dropped outright — the datagram is never parsed and never forwarded.
//! - The socket peer remains `source.ip` / `direct_client_ip` **always**. Only
//!   the authenticated envelope may set `remote.ip` / `client_ip`.
//! - When `FERRUM_DATAGRAM_PROXY_PROTOCOL_SECRET` is configured, every datagram
//!   must additionally carry a valid HMAC-SHA-256 tag ([`AUTH_TLV_TYPE`]) and a
//!   valid freshness record ([`FRESHNESS_TLV_TYPE`]). Source addresses are
//!   trivially spoofable on UDP, so this is the only thing that makes trust in
//!   a datagram peer meaningful on a network the operator does not fully
//!   control.
//! - Anything else fails closed: no signature, truncated header, oversized
//!   address block, wrong address family, any transport but `DGRAM` on a
//!   `PROXY` command (`STREAM` — i.e. a TCP header replayed onto the datagram
//!   path — is refused whatever family it declares, `AF_UNSPEC` included),
//!   malformed TLVs, a missing or invalid authentication tag, a missing or
//!   malformed freshness record, a duplicate/stale sequence, a declared
//!   destination port that does not match the receiving listener, or replay
//!   state exhaustion. There is no fallback to the socket peer, because that
//!   would silently downgrade a spoofed datagram into an accepted one.
//!
//! ## Listener-domain binding
//!
//! The MAC input is
//!
//! ```text
//!   DOMAIN_LABEL || binding_version || protocol_tag
//!                || family_tag || bind_addr octets || listen_port
//!                || <the complete datagram with the 32 tag bytes elided>
//! ```
//!
//! The binding half is [`DatagramListenerBinding`], serialized once at gate
//! construction into a fixed-size inline buffer, so the receive path absorbs it
//! without re-serializing and without allocating. It is derived entirely from
//! *configured/bound listener properties* — never from envelope bytes:
//!
//! - `protocol_tag` distinguishes the plain-UDP receive boundary from the
//!   DTLS-terminating one, so the same numeric port cannot be crossed between a
//!   `udp` and a `dtls` frontend.
//! - `family_tag` + `bind_addr` is the listener's **canonical bind address**
//!   (IPv4-mapped IPv6 folded to IPv4), so a wildcard bind (`0.0.0.0` / `::`)
//!   and a specific-address bind on the same numeric port are different domains
//!   and cannot be crossed either.
//! - `listen_port` is the exact receiving port.
//!
//! Because the binding is inside the MAC input, a cross-listener replay fails
//! as [`DatagramMetadataError::AuthenticationTagMismatch`] for every envelope
//! form. The envelope's own declared destination port is *also* compared to the
//! listener's port as defense in depth; that check runs first, so an
//! address-bearing cross-listener envelope reports the more specific
//! [`DatagramMetadataError::ListenerBindingMismatch`]. Neither check is
//! sufficient alone: the declared destination cannot cover `LOCAL` /
//! `AF_UNSPEC` (they carry no address), and the MAC alone cannot produce a
//! distinguishable reason.
//!
//! The root secret is read once at startup, so it does not rotate under a live
//! listener; a listener reload reconstructs the binding from the live bind
//! address, protocol, and port rather than inheriting the previous listener's.
//!
//! ## Freshness and anti-replay
//!
//! An authenticated envelope carries exactly one [`FRESHNESS_TLV_TYPE`] TLV
//! whose 29-byte value is
//!
//! ```text
//!   version u8 | sender_id u32 BE | epoch u64 BE | sequence u64 BE
//!              | timestamp_ms u64 BE
//! ```
//!
//! Every field is inside the MAC input, so none of it is usable unless the
//! sender holds the root secret and minted it for *this* listener.
//!
//! The receiver keeps one bounded record per authenticated `sender_id`
//! (per listener): the highest admitted sequence for the sender's current
//! epoch, plus a [`REPLAY_WINDOW_BITS`]-bit bitmap of the sequences immediately
//! below it. Check-and-mark happens under a single `DashMap` shard write guard,
//! so it is one synchronization event and two receive workers can never both
//! admit one sequence.
//!
//! - a sequence equal to the highest, or already marked in the window, is a
//!   duplicate;
//! - a sequence more than [`REPLAY_WINDOW_BITS`] behind the highest is stale;
//! - `u64::MAX` is reserved so a sender must roll its epoch before the sequence
//!   space wraps;
//! - an epoch below the sender's current one is stale; a higher epoch is a
//!   sender restart/rotation and reseeds the window at that sequence.
//!
//! `timestamp_ms` is checked against the receiver's clock with a fixed
//! [`FRESHNESS_HORIZON_MS`] tolerance in both directions. That is what makes
//! the *lifecycle* guarantees statable, and what makes bounded eviction safe.
//!
//! ### What is guaranteed, and what is not
//!
//! - **Within one Ferrum process, per listener**: every authenticated envelope
//!   is admitted **at most once**. A byte-for-byte replay is refused before any
//!   session, DTLS allocation, plugin hook, backend send, or idle refresh.
//! - **Across a listener reload, a receiver process restart, or another Ferrum
//!   replica**: replay protection is process-local, so exposure is *bounded to
//!   [`FRESHNESS_HORIZON_MS`]* by the authenticated timestamp horizon — an
//!   envelope older than that is refused by any receiver, restarted or not.
//!   Ferrum does **not** claim cluster-wide anti-replay; the supported
//!   deployment contract is per-flow sender stickiness (a datagram balancer
//!   already pins one client flow to one Ferrum socket) plus that horizon.
//! - **Sender restart**: the sender must publish a strictly higher `epoch`.
//!   Reusing an old epoch with restarted sequence numbers is refused as stale.
//!
//! State is bounded at [`MAX_REPLAY_SENDERS`] senders per listener. At capacity
//! the guard first reclaims entries idle longer than `4 ×
//! FRESHNESS_HORIZON_MS` and, if that frees nothing, refuses with
//! [`DatagramMetadataError::ReplayStateCapacity`] rather than evicting live
//! protection. The idle threshold exceeds `2 × FRESHNESS_HORIZON_MS` on
//! purpose: an envelope that could still be inside the horizon after the
//! reclaim would need a timestamp newer than the entry's last activity plus
//! `2 × FRESHNESS_HORIZON_MS`, so reclaiming can never make an old sequence
//! valid again.
//!
//! Diagnostics are field-specific but bounded: they name the field and, at
//! most, the offending numeric code or length. Payload bytes, tag bytes,
//! secrets, sequence-cache contents, and addresses asserted inside the envelope
//! never appear in a log record.
//!
//! # Relationship to the TCP PROXY parser
//!
//! [`crate::proxy::proxy_protocol`] is the connection-borne TCP parser (v1
//! text and v2 binary, STREAM transport, one header per connection). This
//! module is a separate per-datagram parser: it requires `DGRAM` transport,
//! walks the auth/freshness TLV region, binds the MAC to the receiving
//! listener, enforces freshness, and never allocates on the receive path.
//! Signature, version, family codes, and the 512-byte address-block cap MUST
//! stay aligned with that parser; a spec-level fix must update both. Do not
//! collapse them into one abstraction — the datagram path's transport,
//! auth-TLV, listener-binding, freshness, and hot-path checks would be lost.
//!
//! # Spec references
//!
//! - PROXY protocol v2: <https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt>
//!   (section 2.2; `0x02` is the spec's `DGRAM` transport, and TLV type
//!   `0xE0`.. is reserved for application use.)
