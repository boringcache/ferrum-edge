//! Exact destination routing for shared NodeWaypoint UDP listeners (issue #3861).
//!
//! A NodeWaypoint is `hostNetwork: true`, so it can bind a given UDP port
//! exactly once on the node. Two Kubernetes Services that declare the same UDP
//! port (separate DNS, syslog, telemetry, game or custom-protocol Services in
//! different namespaces) are routine and valid, and the datapath already
//! preserves the discriminator that tells them apart: the Service-path steering
//! rules perform **no** rewrite, so a steered datagram arrives with the original
//! ClusterIP as its local destination and `IP_PKTINFO` / `IPV6_PKTINFO` reports
//! it verbatim.
//!
//! This module turns that kernel fact into an exact route table. One shared
//! datagram listener owns the port; every datagram selects exactly one Service
//! route by canonical `(local destination IP, listen port)` **before** any
//! session lookup, plugin hook, backend selection or accounting runs. The port
//! half of that key is the listener's own bound port, which every datagram this
//! socket receives carries by construction. There is no fallback: an absent or
//! unrecognized local destination is refused before a session slot, pending
//! gate, or backend socket exists.
//!
//! Load-bearing invariants:
//!
//! * **Exactness.** Routes are keyed by a canonicalized `IpAddr` (IPv4-mapped
//!   IPv6 is folded onto its IPv4 form, so a dual-stack `[::]` bind and a
//!   dedicated v4 bind agree). A duplicate exact claim is refused for **every**
//!   ambiguous claimant at materialization, so the table can never hold an
//!   order-dependent winner.
//! * **No inference.** A route is never derived from the numeric port alone.
//!   A Service with no ClusterIP (headless) publishes no destination and is
//!   reachable only over the documented direct-node-address boundary, which
//!   requires the port to have exactly one claimant.
//! * **Lock-free reads.** The table is an immutable snapshot behind an
//!   `ArcSwap`. Adding or removing a Service republishes a complete new table
//!   without restarting the listener, so a second claimant entering the slice
//!   never withdraws the first one's socket.
//! * **Owner identity.** Each route stores its `NamespacedResourceId` as an
//!   `Arc` so the receive path can clone that exact namespaced owner into the
//!   UDP session key without allocating. A destination that changes owner is a
//!   different session; an equivalent republication of the same owner remains
//!   equal. The destination-table generation is not the session identity.
//! * **Bounded diagnostics.** Refusals are a closed `&'static str` enum with
//!   rate-limited warns. Service names never become metric labels.
