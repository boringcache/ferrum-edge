//! Which plugins let one admitted HBONE CONNECT carry LATER application
//! operations (issue #5583).
//!
//! Source-side reuse keeps the inner application connection inside an admitted
//! tunnel, so the destination's per-CONNECT plugin chain runs ONCE where it
//! would otherwise have run once per operation. The relay is a transparent byte
//! tunnel — the destination never parses the inner requests either way — so
//! every one of those elided runs would have carried IDENTICAL request
//! attributes. The only thing that differs across them is TIME, and only two
//! time-varying decisions are re-issued for a live tunnel: the local authorize
//! verdict (the fence's sweep) and the peer's mTLS credential (the fence's
//! credential gate). Everything else — a rate-limit token, a concurrency
//! permit, a mirror dispatch, an external CUSTOM verdict, a bearer credential's
//! own expiry — would be spent once and then honoured indefinitely.
//!
//! `Plugin::allows_hbone_inner_reuse` is therefore fail-closed by default and
//! this table forces every classification to be deliberate. The companion
//! re-evaluation contract lives in `authorize_reevaluation_contract_tests.rs`;
//! the two are coupled, because a `true` justified by "the sweep re-issues it"
//! is only true while that plugin also opts into `reevaluates_live_admission`.
//!
//! Declaring `true` is a STANDING obligation, not a one-time statement: the
//! fence re-folds this classification over the live chain on every sweep and
//! revokes a tunnel it already advertised to (`reuse_withdrawn`) as soon as the
//! chain stops permitting reuse. The end-to-end proof of both halves —
//! advertisement and withdrawal — runs through the production dispatcher in
//! `tests/integration/hbone_admission_fence_tests.rs`.
