//! Kubernetes controller shutdown supervision (issue #3220).
//!
//! CP mode used to keep the controller handle in an underscore-prefixed local
//! and drop it at the end of `run()`, which *detaches* the watcher, reconciler,
//! and CRD reprobe tasks instead of awaiting them; the old `join()` also threw
//! away every `JoinError`, and the CRD reprobe loop dropped the handles of the
//! replacement watchers it created, so those were never owned at all.
//!
//! These tests drive the real `ControllerTaskRegistry` + `K8sControllerHandle`
//! shutdown path with synthetic tasks (no Kubernetes API server required).
//! Registration goes through the same production `spawn_named` lifecycle
//! wrapper the watchers, reconciler, and reprobe loop use, so there is no
//! parallel mock classifier: delayed clean exit, panic propagation,
//! grace-deadline abort with a confirmed terminal drop, completion-boundary
//! early-exit classification under the real control-plane ordering, dynamic
//! (reprobe-style) registration, and refusal once shutdown closed the registry.
//!
//! Every test runs on the default `#[tokio::test]` current-thread runtime, so
//! task interleaving is deterministic instead of depending on a multi-thread
//! scheduler happening to poll in a particular order.
