| Tracks | Ferrum Edge private advisory `GHSA-qq94-2gv2-phh6` — physical WebSocket fragment bypass of `ws_rate_limiting` |

## Why this exists

The reader API (`WebSocket::read`, `WebSocketStream::poll_next`) only ever
yields **fully reassembled** messages. The initial non-final Text/Binary frame
and every Continuation frame before the final one are consumed inside the codec
and are invisible to the caller.

That makes every per-message admission policy layered on top of the codec —
Ferrum's `ws_rate_limiting` among them — bypassable by fragmentation: a peer
sends one non-final frame followed by an unbounded stream of Continuation
frames and pays for at most one logical message. Zero-length continuations make
it worse: they accumulate no bytes, so `max_message_size` never fires either,
and nothing in the stock codec bounds how many frames or how long a message may
stay incomplete.

This patch adds the missing visibility and the missing bounds, without changing
any default:

- `FragmentMeter` — a shared, lock-free counter of physical data frames folded
  into an incomplete message. It is an `Arc` so it survives
  `StreamExt::split()`, which otherwise hides the codec behind a `SplitStream`.
- `WebSocketConfig::max_incomplete_message_frames` and
  `WebSocketConfig::max_incomplete_message_duration` — two **independent**
  ceilings on the in-flight reassembly (count and wall-clock), neither of which
  is expressible with the existing byte ceilings. Both default to `None`
  (upstream behavior).
- `WebSocketContext::set_fragment_accounting()` /
  `WebSocket::set_fragment_accounting()` /
  `WebSocketStream::set_fragment_accounting()` — one setter that installs the
  meter and both bounds before the first read.
- `ProtocolError::IncompleteMessageFrameLimitExceeded` and
  `ProtocolError::IncompleteMessageTimeout` — distinct failure origins so a
  caller can map them to a policy Close rather than a size Close.

Accounting is deliberately per **message**: it resets at every message
boundary, so a long-lived connection of legitimately fragmented messages is
unaffected. The completing frame is *not* metered — it becomes the returned
message, which the caller already charges once — so a caller that charges both
the batch and the message counts each wire frame exactly once.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tungstenite-fragment-accounting.patch` | Unified diff against the vendored 0.29.0 base (both crates) |
| `README.md` | This status / retirement record |

## Hand-off — how to file upstream

1. Open an issue on [snapview/tungstenite-rs](https://github.com/snapview/tungstenite-rs)
   describing the fragmentation-bypass problem for proxies and per-message
   policy layers, and proposing the accounting hook plus the two bounds.
2. Push a fork branch with the patch applied and open a PR; open the matching
   `tokio-tungstenite` PR for the `WebSocketStream` delegator.
3. Record the issue + PR numbers here, in `docs/dependency-policy.md`, and in
   `scripts/check_vendored_patch_status.sh`.

## Retirement

Retire when an upstream release consumed by ferrum-edge exposes an equivalent
way to (a) observe physical fragments before reassembly completes and (b) bound
incomplete-message frame count and duration independently of byte size, **and**
the co-vendored tungstenite / tokio-tungstenite patches are also ready to
retire (see the parent [README](../README.md)). Until then this remains a
deliberate, time-boxed fork owned by `@jeremyjpj0916` under the
dependency-policy SLA.

## Behavioral regressions

- Vendored: `fragment_meter_counts_zero_length_continuations`,
  `fragment_meter_ignores_unfragmented_messages`,
  `incomplete_message_frame_limit_fails_closed`,
  `incomplete_message_duration_limit_fails_closed`,
  `incomplete_message_duration_zero_arms_on_initial_frame`,
  `incomplete_message_duration_rejects_final_continuation_bypass`,
  `incomplete_message_duration_rejects_interleaved_ping_pong`,
  `incomplete_message_close_bypasses_duration_bound`,
  `fragment_accounting_resets_between_messages`, and
  `fragment_bounds_default_to_unbounded` in
  `vendor/tungstenite-0.29.0-ferrum-patched` (`--lib fragment` /
  `--lib incomplete_message`).
- External unit: `tests/unit/gateway_core/websocket_fragment_metering_tests.rs`
  (metering, no-double-charge, both directions, observer exclusion, parser
  bound → policy Close mapping, duration bound on final continuation and
  interleaved Ping/Pong, peer Close exemption).
