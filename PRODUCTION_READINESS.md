# Production Readiness Ledger — Ferrum Edge

Product-readiness epic executed 2026-07-12 (orchestrated multi-agent audit + remediation).
Method: four independent read-only audits (deferral markers, docs-vs-code truth, security
posture, ops/CI/release) → findings triaged → fixes implemented via reviewed PRs (codex
review loop + full CI + orchestrator review on every PR) → merged.

## Live launch gate (removed)

The automated launch-readiness gate that used to own this section was removed
(workflows `launch-readiness.yml`, `launch-integrity.yml`,
`launch-advisory-trust.yml`, their verifiers, the blocker policy and exemption
data, and the `validate-launch-readiness` job in `.github/workflows/release.yml`).
Every blocker it tracked had been closed: its last evaluation on `main` reported
`"blocking_issues": []` with `critical 0 / high 0 / medium 0`.

There is therefore **no automated go/no-go launch signal in this repository**.
Release readiness is a human judgement, and a `v*` tag no longer requires a
computed launch verdict or a private-advisory attestation. The historical
evidence below is exactly that — historical — and was never a live verdict.

## Historical epic summary (not the live gate)

The tables below record the 2026-07-12 product-readiness epic and later ledger
reconciliations. They are **historical evidence**, not the live launch verdict.

| Gate | Historical status (epic / audit evidence) |
|------|--------|
| Feature set implemented or proven out of scope | Historical PASS — zero doc overclaims across README/FEATURES/62 docs; genuine deferrals documented with graceful behavior. Historical umbrella: #2110; later residuals: dedicated issues (see Current residual map; no automated launch gate) |
| All deferral markers resolved or tracked | Historical PASS — ~259 raw markers triaged: 1 medium fixed (PR #2113), lows fixed (#2114) or tracked; completed epic rows reconciled below; live leftovers use dedicated issues |
| Critical/high/medium bugs fixed | Historical static-audit evidence — 0 *new untracked* critical/high found in the 2026-07-12 audits; all 5 epic mediums fixed and merged. **Not** a claim about the current launch backlog |
| Docs truthful vs code | Historical PASS — stale REFACTORING_PLAN.md retired, WEBSOCKET.md/admin_api.md corrected (PR #2112); config/openapi/plugin-priority parity verified clean |
| Security posture verified | Historical PASS — 0 crit/high/med in the epic security audit; both lows hardened (PR #2114); CRL revocation now symmetric inbound/outbound (PR #2113) |
| Deployment/CI/release readiness | Historical PASS — tag↔version guard + CHANGELOG policy (PR #2109); flake redness remediated pre-epic (#2057/#2060 fixes + #2103), main monitored green through the epic |

## Merged work (all codex-clean + CI-green + orchestrator-reviewed)

| PR | Closes | Delivered |
|----|--------|-----------|
| #2105 | #2104 | Live two-cluster gate: blanket NEW-TCP REJECT firewall-proves Ambient east-west traversal; self-check asserts dest gateway inbound ports unreachable |
| #2109 | #2107 | release.yml tag↔Cargo-version guard gating all publish jobs; CHANGELOG.md + policy; docs/ci_cd.md |
| #2112 | #2111 | REFACTORING_PLAN.md retired (live remainder → #2110); WEBSOCKET.md tunnel-mode section (verified vs code); admin_api.md LB list |
| #2113 | #2106 | Mesh outbound SPIFFE CRL revocation parity (HBONE + mesh-mTLS pools), consuming the live-reload SharedCrlList slot with reload-race pooling guards; honest revocation docs (unknown-status allowance documented); revoked/unrevoked dial tests |
| #2114 | #2108 | CSR proof-of-possession verification (transport-agnostic, x509-parser verify); FERRUM_ADMIN_JWT_AUDIENCE (strict RFC 7519 default kept + pinned by test); stale UDP deferral message fixed; release image log level error→warn |

## Findings ledger (final)

| ID | Finding | Severity | Disposition |
|----|---------|----------|-------------|
| PR-001 | Ambient live-gate row not firewall-proven | Medium (test integrity) | FIXED (PR #2105) |
| PR-002 | Outbound mesh SPIFFE verification skipped CRLs (inbound-only asymmetry) | Medium (security) | FIXED (PR #2113, 3 codex rounds incl. live-reload slot + race guards) |
| PR-003 | InternalCa CSR path lacked proof-of-possession | Low (hardening) | FIXED (PR #2114 — real PoP verification) |
| PR-004 | SPIFFE Workload API JWT-SVID unimplemented (X.509 complete) | Low | FIXED — [#3675](https://github.com/ferrum-edge/ferrum-edge/pull/3675) resolves [#3617](https://github.com/ferrum-edge/ferrum-edge/issues/3617). `FERRUM_MESH_CA_BACKEND=internal` implements mint / validate / JWT bundle streaming behind `FERRUM_MESH_WORKLOAD_API_ENABLED`, with operator-configured ES256 signing material (restart + multi-replica continuity), **externally-rotated-only signing keys** (an in-process replacement for configured material is refused, since it would diverge per replica and vanish on restart), and a provable rotation overlap for the dev-only ephemeral key. `FetchJWTBundles` never streams an empty map. **Serving a Workload API on `FERRUM_MESH_CA_BACKEND=spire` is refused at startup** because the agent cannot issue for an attested downstream workload; the active SPIRE runtime continues to consume X.509 identity and trust bundles but does not start a JWT-bundle stream |
| PR-005 | k8s controller Merge-Patch status writes (SSA TODO); naming-convention proxy-id | Low | FIXED (PR #2152) — intentional mixed strategy: resourceVersion-guarded RMW for Route `status.parents[]` (Gateway API list ownership), SSA + stable `fieldManager` for Gateway/GatewayClass conditions, plus typed proxy-id mapping. Not a blanket "convert everything to SSA" TODO. |
| PR-006 | Stale "F3 §3.3 UDP not implemented" message | Low (accuracy) | FIXED (PR #2114) |
| PR-007 | Log schema not applied to WsDisconnectLogEntry | Low | FIXED — `WsDisconnectLogEntry` implements `SchemaSerializable`; see `docs/log_schema.md` WebSocket disconnect family |
| PR-008 | Main redness from flakes #2057/#2060 + port races | Medium (ops) | RESOLVED pre-epic (fixes + #2103); main monitored green through epic |
| PR-009 | No release tag↔version guard | Medium (ops) | FIXED (PR #2109) |
| PR-010 | No CHANGELOG/policy | Medium (ops) | FIXED (PR #2109) |
| PR-011 | Admin JWT lacked optional aud validation | Low (hardening) | FIXED (PR #2114; strict default deliberately kept — see below) |
| PR-012 | Release image log level hid startup warns | Low | FIXED (PR #2114) |
| PR-013 | No Helm chart for core gateway modes | Low | FIXED — `charts/ferrum-gateway` deploys database/file/cp/dp (see chart README + `docs/kubernetes_deployment.md`) |
| PR-014 | Stress tests excluded from CI | Low | FIXED — PR CI still excludes the 30k/10k suites; scheduled coverage is `.github/workflows/scaling-regression.yml` |
| PR-015 | Stale REFACTORING_PLAN.md; WEBSOCKET.md/admin_api.md gaps | Medium (stale root doc) | FIXED (PR #2112) |
| PR-016 | Documented feature deferrals (accurately labeled) | Low | PARTIALLY SUPERSEDED — mesh HTTP retry re-screen closed (#2008); remaining product deferrals live in dedicated issues (see Current residual map). #2110 is the historical 2026-07-12 register, not the live backlog. |

## Audit verifications (no action needed — recorded to prevent relitigating)

- Security: admin API single JWT gate with tiered observability exactly per rules; JWT
  validate_exp/nbf + fixed algorithm; constant-time credential comparisons; mesh authz
  DENY-first fail-closed; no secret logging; smuggling guards per RFC 9112; anchored
  resource-id validation; recursive credential rejection in spec extractor; deny.toml
  ignores all rationaled with future expiry; SSRF/DNS-rebinding posture (PR #1933) intact.
- Docs: configuration.md ↔ env_config.rs zero dead vars; openapi.yaml 1:1 with admin
  dispatch; all 82 plugins in openapi; priorities match plugin_execution_order.md.
- Ops: CI aggregate gate has no always()-escape; #[ignore] functional tests DO run
  (nextest --run-ignored=all); shard-coverage gates active; injector/node_agent/migrate
  modes all have functional tests; licenses consistent; Docker ports match docs.

## Deliberate decisions (do not "fix" without revisiting rationale)

- **Admin JWT `aud` unset ⇒ strict**: tokens carrying `aud` are rejected when
  FERRUM_ADMIN_JWT_AUDIENCE is unset (RFC 7519 §4.1.3, jsonwebtoken default, pre-existing
  behavior). Loosening would enable cross-service token replay under HS256 secret reuse.
  Pinned by `test_audience_unset_rejects_aud_bearing_token`.
- **Mesh CRL unknown-revocation allowance**: peers whose revocation status is
  undeterminable (no CRL from their issuing CA) are accepted, matching the shared inbound
  model; removing it would break federated meshes lacking per-CA CRLs. Documented in
  docs/mesh.md.
- **Fail-fast panics in shipping profiles**: `[profile.release]`,
  `[profile.ci-release]` (inherits `release`), and `[profile.max-perf]` set
  `panic = "abort"` (issue #4166). A panic anywhere in the process —
  including a background poller, accept loop, k8s controller task, or
  notification settle callback — terminates the gateway. There is no
  in-process panic recovery in shipping binaries: smaller binaries (no
  unwind tables) and fail-fast after a violated invariant beat restarting a
  task whose process state may already be inconsistent. Background-task
  supervisors still handle non-panic unexpected exits (I/O errors,
  unexpected completion, cancellation) and keep serving last-known-good
  config where that policy already exists. Dev/test/`pr-build` keep
  `panic = "unwind"` so the suite can observe `JoinError::is_panic()`;
  those tests are not shipping behavior. Operators must run a process
  supervisor (systemd, Kubernetes `restartPolicy`). Pinned by
  `tests/unit/gateway_core/build_profile_panic_strategy_tests.rs`.
- Pre-existing intentional trade-offs re-confirmed: WAF body gates, JWKS retain guard,
  dedup try_lock eviction, MCP stale-template serving, H3 streaming-trailer limitation,
  kTLS KeyUpdate userspace fallback, mcp_gateway V1 tool-result rejection.

## Needs human decision (historical note)

Launch-blocking human decisions are no longer represented by any automated gate
or structured exemption file; both were removed. This historical note must not be
read as a clean launch signal. Post-launch discretionary items that remain open
are tracked on their **dedicated** issues (not by treating #2110 as an unchanged
snapshot). GitHub issue #2110 is CLOSED (COMPLETED, 2026-07-28) and remains the
historical 2026-07-12 register only via `docs/backlog/issue_2110_register.md`.
Completed rows (Helm chart, scheduled stress job, mixed k8s status ownership,
WsDisconnect schema, closed #2008/#2013/#2475, TLS-SNI L4 support) must not be
re-opened from the issue body alone.

## Current residual map

**Last narrative reconciliation:** 2026-08-18 (issue #3893). PR #4010 removed the
launch-readiness workflows, verifiers, policy inventory, and the
`validate-launch-readiness` release job. There is no live gate and no
open-inventory artifact. This table is a human-maintained leftover ledger from
the 2026-07-12 epic (plus the still-open 2026-08-15 CI tracker), not an automated
go/no-go signal and not an inventory of every open GitHub issue.

Rows below cite only issues that were OPEN when this reconcile ran (`gh issue
view --json number,state,title`). Closed former residuals are recorded under
Implemented since the epic. Ordinary post-launch bugs and CI trackers live on
their dedicated issues.

| Residual | Issue(s) | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Provenance-complete mesh/HBONE/DNS perf baselines | #3332 | OPEN — harnesses exist; hosted collection PRs have landed; checked-in `baseline.md` tables still `_TBD_`. No closing PR. |
| Scheduled Scaling Regression red (JWT expiry / 503 retry) | #3892 | OPEN — 2026-08-15 CI tracker; PR #3895 in flight. Not claimed resolved. |
